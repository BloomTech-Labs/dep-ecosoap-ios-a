### About Eco-Soap Bank
Eco-Soap Bank is an award-winning international humanitarian and environmental nonprofit
organization employing economically disadvantaged women in 10 developing countries to
recycle leftover soap from hotels and manufacturers and redistribute it to save lives. The
organization currently employs 154 women and has sustainably supplied more than 3 million
people with lifesaving soap and hygiene education.

### The App
The EcoSoap iOS app allows hub administrators to manage their daily activity including:
- monitoring the status of each hotel property's recycling bins and scheduling Pickups when full, 
- creating daily Production Reports that help track the hub's progress towards important goals, and 
- allowing app users to view the important "Impact Stats" created from data submitted in the Production Reports.
